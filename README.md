# Breatho Website
Our project is dedicated to developing a website that fosters self-sustainability within local environments, with a primary focus on campuses. Self-sustainability, in our context, entails creating campuses that can meet their oxygen needs independently through sufficient tree planting, consequently reducing pollution and cooling the surrounding area.

The website operates in phase:
1. TreeVisonary:- Users input both the population and existing tree numbers, resulting in the generation of comprehensive reports and pictorial representations. These reports offer clear insights into the campus's sustainability level and provide actionable solutions to achieve desired ratios.

Our Unique Selling Proposition (USP) encompasses:
1. Comprehensive Reports :- Delivering fully analysed reports with easy-to-understand pictorials, providing valuable insights into campus sustainability.
2. Zone Classification :- Categorizing campuses into color-based zones for intuitive assessment of environmental health.
4. Precise Algorithms :- Utilizing accurate algorithms built on thorough research to ensure reliable data analysis.
5. User-Friendly Interface :- Providing a seamless experience with an intuitive interface for effortless navigation.

Future goals:
1. Expansion Beyond Campuses :- Extending the website's reach to promote sustainability in various environments beyond campuses.
2. Verification by Dignified Authorities :- Subjecting reports to analysis and verification by respected authorities to enhance credibility.
3. Real-Time Environmental Monitoring :- Implementing hardware sensors for real-time monitoring of environmental factors like air quality and temperature.
4. Integration of Environmental factors :- Enhancing sustainability assessments by integrating temperature changes into our analysis.
5. Green Infrastructure Mapping :- Offering green infrastructure mapping services to optimize environmental management strategies.
